# E-commerce Platform Deployment with Terraform on Azure

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up an e-commerce platform on Microsoft Azure using Terraform. The deployment leverages various Azure services to create a scalable, secure, and efficient infrastructure.

---
## Prerequisites
	•	Azure Subscription: Ensure you have an active Azure subscription with appropriate permissions to create resources.
	•	Terraform Installed: Install Terraform on your local machine. Follow the official installation guide for detailed instructions.
	•	Azure CLI Configured: Install and configure the Azure CLI with your subscription credentials.

---
## Deployment Steps

1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Here2ServeU/ecommerce-platform-azure.git
cd ecommerce-platform-azure
```

2. Initialize Terraform

terraform init

3. Review and Edit Variables
	•	Open the variables.tf file to review the configurable variables.
	•	Edit the terraform.tfvars file to provide environment-specific values.

4. Plan the Deployment

terraform plan

Review the execution plan to understand the resources that will be created or modified.

5. Apply the Configuration

terraform apply

Confirm the prompt to proceed with the deployment.

6. Post-Deployment Verification

Upload your web application files to the Azure Storage Account in the Dev Environment:

az storage blob upload --account-name <storage_account_name> --container-name <container_name> --file path/to/index.html
az storage blob upload --account-name <storage_account_name> --container-name <container_name> --file path/to/error.html
az storage blob upload --account-name <storage_account_name> --container-name <container_name> --file path/to/logo.png

You can access the Azure Portal to verify the creation of resources. Test the e-commerce platform endpoints to ensure proper functionality.

Azure Services Utilized

Azure Storage Account:
	•	Stores static assets such as images, videos, and documents.
	•	Provides scalable and highly available storage.

Azure API Management:
	•	Serves as a fully managed service to create, deploy, and maintain APIs.
	•	Acts as the entry point for client requests, routing them to appropriate backend services.

Azure Function Apps:
	•	Executes backend business logic in a serverless environment.
	•	Scales automatically with the volume of incoming requests.

Azure CosmosDB:
	•	Provides a fully managed NoSQL database for storing user data, product catalogs, and session information.
	•	Offers low-latency data access at any scale.

Azure MySQL Database:
	•	Manages relational databases for transactional data.
	•	Ensures high availability and automated backups.

Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
	•	Controls access to Azure resources through roles and policies.
	•	Ensures secure interactions between services.

Azure Service Bus:
	•	Facilitates messaging and notifications for events like order confirmations.
	•	Supports multiple communication protocols.

How It All Works Together
	1.	Frontend: Users access the website served from the Azure Storage Account and delivered globally using Azure Front Door.
	2.	Backend APIs: API requests are routed through Azure API Management to the Azure Function Apps.
	3.	Data Processing:
	•	NoSQL data (e.g., user sessions, product catalogs) is stored in Azure CosmosDB.
	•	Relational data (e.g., transactions) is stored in Azure MySQL Database.
	4.	Notifications: Notifications (e.g., order confirmation emails) are sent using Azure Service Bus Topics.
	5.	Security: Azure RBAC ensures secure and appropriate access to resources.

Clean Up

To dismantle the infrastructure established by your Terraform configurations, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to Your Terraform Configuration Directory

cd path/to/your/terraform/configuration

2. Execute the Destroy Command

terraform destroy

Terraform will generate an execution plan detailing the resources slated for destruction. Review this plan carefully. If you approve, confirm the operation when prompted.

3. Automate Approval (Optional)

terraform destroy -auto-approve

4. Target Specific Resources (Optional)

terraform destroy -target=azurerm_storage_account.example

5. Post-Destruction Verification

After completion, verify through the Azure Portal or CLI that all intended resources have been terminated.

Security Best Practices for Your Azure E-commerce Platform

1. Identity and Access Management:
	•	Principle of Least Privilege: Assign users and services only the permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
	•	Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enforce MFA for all privileged accounts.
	•	Periodic Reviews: Regularly review RBAC roles and policies.

2. Data Protection:
	•	Encryption: Use Azure Key Vault to manage encryption keys and secrets.
	•	Backups: Enable automated backups for critical data in CosmosDB and MySQL.

3. Network Security:
	•	Azure Virtual Network (VNet): Deploy resources within a VNet to isolate them from public access.
	•	Azure Firewall: Use Azure Firewall and Network Security Groups to control inbound and outbound traffic.
	•	DDoS Protection: Leverage Azure DDoS Protection to safeguard against attacks.

4. Monitoring and Logging:
	•	Azure Monitor: Track resource performance and metrics.
	•	Azure Security Center: Get insights into security configurations and compliance.
	•	Log Analytics: Centralize and analyze logs from all resources.

5. Compliance and Governance:
	•	Azure Policy: Enforce compliance with organizational policies.
	•	Regular Assessments: Conduct vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.

By following these practices, you can establish a secure and reliable Azure-based e-commerce platform.
